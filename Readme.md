# College Management System (MERN Stack)

This is a **full-stack College Management System** built using **MERN Stack technology** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).

The system is designed to help **students, teachers, HODs, college staff, and principals** manage day-to-day college operations efficiently — all within a single, connected environment.

In simple terms, this project acts as a **college management software** that streamlines communication, document handling, and task coordination between all users in a college ecosystem.

##  Project Overview

Every part of this project — from models and controllers to API routes and frontend components — has been carefully structured and written with clarity and purpose.  
You can explore the `backend/models` folder to understand each **data model** and its reasoning, where I’ve explained the logic and need behind every entity.

##  Backend Overview

**Technologies Used:**
- **Node.js** → Backend runtime environment  
- **Express.js** → RESTful API framework  
- **MongoDB** → NoSQL database for efficient data storage  
- **Mongoose** → ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB  
- **Nodemailer & Resend API** → For email verification and notifications  
- **Cloudinary API** → For storing and managing images, PDFs, and other documents  
- **JSON Web Token (JWT)** → For secure authentication and authorization  
- **Postman** → Used for testing all backend RESTful APIs  

The backend follows the **MVC (Model–View–Controller)** architecture to ensure:
- Clean and maintainable code  
- High scalability for production use  
- Easy readability and debugging  

You can explore the `backend` folder to see how each part of the server-side code has been structured for **production-grade quality**.

##  Frontend Overview

**Technologies Used:**
- **React.js** → For building a fast, responsive frontend  
- **Redux** → For state management and instant data updates  
- **ShadCN/UI** → Open-source UI library used to enhance design and user experience  

Just like the backend, the frontend also follows a well-structured and maintainable pattern:
- **Components** → Reusable UI blocks  
- **Pages** → Separated by feature and route  
- **MVC-style organization** for clarity and scalability  

You can explore the `frontend` folder to see the clean folder structure and how the entire UI has been designed for both **simplicity and efficiency**.

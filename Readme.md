# Daily Project what i do.

## Today Task 09 oct ðŸ‘‡ This is all we are do before monday. And Comolete all Api Part then move to the Frontend , Writing all aspect how many api's we have a get request and according to make a that one api get route there we are append all get api's

Note :- First, the main thing is to create this API step by step and one by one. Whenever this API is to be created, first we need to get a complete view of that API: how the data will come from the frontend, how it will be stored in the database, and how it will be processed on the backend. Then, we also need to figure out which particular API should be shown to whom (i.e., access control), and how to retrieve that data from the database. I plan to implement all this on one page (or document) first, and only after that will I begin the development process."

// Making a some feature only accessible in the frontend we are not sending a that data at backend. Means if user student come first time and he will select student option but we are also show a one more option to select their department because once a department fetch and validate we are show data according to that department at the selecting field . And we are also store a that department data their local storage for better options.

## Know Make a flow how we are make our next controller and what's a step by step guide which controller be first and then next because it is important to decide becuase many of the api we are get user details by it's details so that why make sure Make all backend flow below . and then after that we are easy to thing about how our frontend work and what a element and how many pages we are need that add only usefull things not a random stuff ..
```

## Below Next Backend flow ðŸ‘‡ 
## Below Backend Get Api's we need to append data on "Frontend"ðŸ‘‡ 
## Frontend Pages How much are neccessary ðŸ‘‡

```
 All Type of User have same basic Authenticated and Authorization Page Below Like ðŸ‘‡
```
- >> Register Page.
- >> Login Page.
- >> Forgot Password Page.
```
 Below Similar Models Used By Type of User But Only Students ðŸ‘‡
```
- >> Assign Task Page // Access by Hod's Teacher and Principal. >>> But Not Developer
- >> Help Page // Access by Hod's Teacher and Principal. >>> But Not Developer
- >> Event Image upload Page // Access by Hod's Teacher and Principal. Also Developer.
- >> MarkSheet Create Page // Access by Hod's and Teacher.

- Note :- For other Authentication and Authorization Like -> changeAvatar, changeEmail, changePassword, deactivateAccount, logout,   updateStudentDetailsOnDB, verifyOtpEmail, verifyViaEmail :- These Authentication and Authorization for we are creating a components or icons in pages not specifically create a anotheter page , because it take so much lengthy that' why ..

```
Now These Above type of pages are defined because we have a Data Moels Clearty. But Now We have No idea how much are total need and create so that's why what we do right know i'll first create all Api End Points and then figure out How much api's data append page need and how many dynamic web pages create. Before Creating a pages first of all we are create all api routes they are give us idea how data are receive and sent.
```

```
```
Now We Have an idea what we do i think when we make a backend API's for example Api of create a Student Marksheet details firstly make that frontend flow we are taking a data from a frontend , they got me a idea how data store next step is that make a backend of that particular Api after that a check that api thru postman once APi create a successfully , check there data on database and figure out how that Api data show on frontend and it's all about of that one particular api . Similary to that next one ... This Help to give a idea about software how they work and also help me to figure out how new things. features and Pages add ...
